## Hi! This is Leaf.
I am a programmer who currently know HTML, CSS, Javascript, Python, jQuery, p5js, SASS, SQL, Vue.js etc.<br>
I am learning C++, React.js, Node.js, Blockchain technology etc.<br>
I am crazy about technology and my interests are mainly programming, physics, maths and basically everything logical and related to tech.<br>
Currently I make websites, webapps and anything that I can make to bring an impact.<br><br>

I think this is enough about me.<br>
I will be adding my future projects on github and host it here and on replit --- so stay tuned!<br><br>

You can find me at places with either `leafkn` or `knaagar`
